# Exploring-Donations-to-Presidential-Campaign-for-TN
The dataset chosen is the Financial Contributions to Presidential Campaigns for State of Tenneessee in 2012 since I am living in Tenneesse. I wish to find something interesting regarding presidential election donations. What kind of people were donating money to which party? How much did they donate? Which party had more advantanges over others in TN? How did people donate money to their supporting party over time? I tried to answer them by exploring the dataset.
